### Task: Create a notification

Created function `pushNotification`, which takes coordinates of the message, title, description, and type 
(success, error and warning). `pushNotification` creates an element to display the message, appends it to the document, and hides it from the DOM after 2 seconds.

It's an expected result of your job:
